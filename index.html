    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AIScanner</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the AIScanner mobile application (the "App") and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal data collected through the AIScanner App on iOS devices and any associated web pages or customer support channels. The App is currently available for iOS only.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the Service. The categories below describe the types of information we may collect.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Email address (for account, support, receipts, notifications if you provide one).</li>
        <li><strong>Account preferences:</strong> Language, display preferences, subscription choices.</li>
        <li><strong>User-generated content:</strong> Scanned documents, images, annotations, OCR results and any content you create, upload, import or store through the App ("<strong>Your Content</strong>").</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Any feedback, surveys or communications you send to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and usage data:</strong> Device model, operating system version, device identifiers (e.g., IDFV), app version, crash and diagnostics data, log files, and usage analytics (how you use features, pages you view, timestamps).</li>
        <li><strong>Performance data:</strong> App performance metrics, errors and diagnostic information.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Approximate location derived from device locale or time zone. We do not collect precise GPS location unless you explicitly enable a feature that requires it (and if so we will ask for permission separately via iOS prompts).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <p>We may receive information from service providers, partners, or third-party integrations (for example, analytics providers or cloud providers). We may also obtain information when you choose to sign in or connect using a third-party account.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide and operate the App:</strong> To provide core scanning, editing, conversion (PDF/JPG/TXT OCR), and document management features.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions and billing:</strong> To manage subscription status, free-trials, billing confirmations and to provide receipts. (Payments are processed by Apple — see section “Apple and In-App Purchases” below.)</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the Service:</strong> Analytics, diagnostics, and aggregated performance metrics to improve features and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing OCR / Server-side features:</strong> Some features (for example, server-side OCR, cloud backup, or advanced processing) may require transmitting content to our servers or trusted third-party providers — with your consent where required.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and communications:</strong> To respond to support requests, send important notices, security alerts, and administrative messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud prevention and security:</strong> To detect and prevent fraud, abuse and security incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, subpoenas, and law enforcement requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (EU / EEA Users)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, our legal bases for processing personal data include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> Processing necessary to provide the Service or perform a contract with you (e.g., to deliver features you request or to manage subscriptions).</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where we ask for your consent (for example, for certain analytics or server-side OCR features), we will only process data with your consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> For security, product improvement, and fraud prevention, balanced with your privacy rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> When required to comply with law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>We may share collected information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We share data with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, OCR providers, analytics, crash reporting, email delivery, customer support). These providers are contractually bound to use the data only to provide services to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Apple processes payments for in-app purchases/subscriptions and may provide related transaction data to us (limited to what Apple allows). All payment handling and refunds are governed by Apple’s policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with laws, legal processes, or government requests, or to protect the rights, property or safety of AIScanner, our users, or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If AIScanner engages in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction (with notice where required by law).</li>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We will share data in other ways when we have your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. On-Device Processing vs. Server Processing</h2>
    <p>Whenever feasible, AIScanner performs scanning, image enhancement, and OCR locally on your iOS device to maximize privacy and reduce data transmission. Some optional or advanced features (for example, cloud backup, higher-accuracy server-side OCR, collaborative features, or data sync) may require uploading Your Content to our servers or to third-party providers. Those features will be clearly described in-app and we will request your consent before uploading content.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and for legitimate business needs. If you request deletion of your account and associated data, we will delete or anonymize stored personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution).</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the personal data we hold about you;</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal exceptions);</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict processing of your data;</li>
        <li>Request portability of your personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable format;</li>
        <li>Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (for EU/EEA/UK residents).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We will verify your identity before fulfilling requests and may decline requests that are legally restricted or disproportionate (for example, excessive or manifestly unfounded requests).</p>

    <h2>9. California Residents (CCPA / CPRA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and related laws, including the right to request: (1) a copy of personal information collected about you; (2) deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions); and (3) information about categories of personal information sold or disclosed for business purposes. We do not sell personal information in exchange for monetary consideration. To submit a verifiable request, please contact us as set out below. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under that age. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us and we will take prompt steps to delete the information.</p>

    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, and destruction. Examples include access controls, encryption in transit (TLS), and routine security assessments. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>AIScanner is based in China (address below). Information we collect may be stored and processed in countries other than your country of residence. Where required by applicable law, we will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect transferred data.</p>

    <h2>13. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites and services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing personal information.</p>

    <h2>14. Apple and In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>All subscriptions and in-app purchases are processed by Apple via the App Store. Apple’s privacy practices and terms apply to those transactions. For subscription management, refunds, cancellations, and billing support, please refer to Apple’s documentation and support. We may receive limited information about your purchase (e.g., transaction confirmation) from Apple to manage your subscription status in the App.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will provide notice in the App or by other means (for example, email). Your continued use of the App after the updated Privacy Policy becomes effective indicates your acceptance of the changes.</p>

    <p class="small"><strong>Note:</strong> This Privacy Policy is intended to transparently describe our practices as of the date above. It is not a substitute for legal advice. If you need a jurisdiction-specific privacy policy (for example to cover special rules in the EU, UK, or specific U.S. states), or a translated version, we can prepare customized variants.</p>
